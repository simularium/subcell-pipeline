# Wall clock times

## Single actin fiber compressed at different compression velocities

Analysis extracts wall clock times from the `COMPRESSION_VELOCITY` simulation series, which simulates compression of a single 500 nm actin fiber at four different velocities (4.7, 15, 47, and 150 μm/s) with five replicates.
