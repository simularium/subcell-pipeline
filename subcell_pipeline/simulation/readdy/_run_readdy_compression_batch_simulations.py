"""
Notebook contains steps for running ReaDDy simulations in which a single actin
fiber is compressed at different compression velocities.

Simulations use the ReaDDy actin model defined
[here](https://github.com/simularium/readdy-models/tree/main/examples/actin).
Instructions for running this model on AWS Batch are provided
[here](https://github.com/simularium/readdy-models/blob/main/examples/README.md).

After simulations are complete, use this notebook to copy output files into the
file structure used by this pipeline.
