"""
Notebook contains steps for post processing of ReaDDy simulations in which a
single actin fiber is compressed at different compression velocities.

This notebook provides an example of processing a simulation series in which
there are multiple conditions, each of which were run with multiple replicates.
For an example of processing a simulation series with a single condition with
multiple replicates, see `process_readdy_no_compression_simulations.py`.

Iterate through all condition keys and replicates to load simulation output

condition key and replicate already exists, parsing is skipped.
